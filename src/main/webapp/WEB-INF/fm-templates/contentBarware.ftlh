                  served in a glass without any ice.</p>

                  as well as creating layered drinks by various techniques (often involving pouring

                  different cone-sized compartments-one most often holds 1.5 oz., while the other
                  holds a fraction or multiple of that.</p>

                  material serves an important purpose. When a cold drink is added, a frost will
                  form on the outside of the cup and will help keep the contents nice and chilly.

                  sets-they come in so many different
                  colors, shapes, and sizes. Although the punch bowl mug that we have pictured here
                  has a handle, some accompanying glasses may be more like tumblers. Punch bowls are
                  typically large enough to hold at least 32 ounces, while the individual glasses
                  range from about 6 to 8 ounces.</p>

                  tops and lean long cylindrical
                  figures, these glasses are great for carbonated drinks like our Sweet Citrus
                  Fizz-they keep the fizz in!</p>

                  holding a variety of cocktails (we like to use them for drinks served without
                  ice). Its broad bowl, which sits upon a short stem, allows more bubbles to escape,
                  so we don't recommend using it for carbonated drinks.</p>

                  glasses, these glasses are slightly
                  shorter and wider. They're usually used for drinks that have a higher ratio of
                  "mixer" to liquor (i.e. our Raspberry Mojito, which has a higher ratio of club
                  soda to rum). That's rightâ€”all those years you were drinking Rum & Cokes out of
                  red plastic cups, you should have been drinking them from highballs!</p>

                  aroma to drift up to the drinker as they sip. They usually are stemmed, but are
                  available without stems as well.</p>

                  used bar glasses, the pint glass
                  is primarily used to serve beer. Usually they're an inverted cone-shape (with the
                  pointy tops cut off of course!). True to its name, the U.S. pint glass holds 16
                  ounces, although if you're in Britain, the pint glass usually holds 20 ounces.</p>

                  different "bowl" sizes to allow for different flavor concentrations and aromas to
                  arise from each wine. These stemless versions are becoming quite the trend and can

                  this glass gets its name-the wide
                  bowl lets some of the liquor release while the narrow top traps the aroma and
                  allows the user to "sniff" the contents. Traditionally this short-stemmed glass is
                  used for warm spirits, such as brandy, but we've shaken it up a bit and use this
                  fun glass for some of our cool cocktails like the Roasted Strawberry and Jalapeno
                  Freezer!</p>

                  or are specially insulated-like the mug tumblers we used in our Vanilla Bean Irish
                  Coffee recipe). They're larger than teacups and more casual.</p>
